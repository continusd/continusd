# Get Started

When your Codespace is all set up, you'll see the VS Code editor on your screen. Hold tight for a moment as your terminal completes its setup - this usually takes around 5 minutes.

After the setup is finished, you're all ready to begin your learning journey. Look for the "CODETOUR" button on the bottom left of your screen and give it a click to get started. Enjoy!
